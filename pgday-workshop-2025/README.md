## 📈 Key Tuning Scenarios

### Memory Tuning
```sql
-- Test work_mem impact
SET work_mem = '1MB';   -- May cause external sorts
SET work_mem = '32MB';  -- Should eliminate external sorts

-- Monitor buffer cache
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * sum(blks_hit) / (sum(blks_hit) + sum(blks_read)), 2) || '%' 
FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = current_database();
```

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM performance_test WHERE id = 50000;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, idx_scan 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables ORDER BY seq_scan DESC;
```

### Advanced Features
```sql
-- JSONB optimization
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE profile_data->>'age' = '25';

-- Full-text search
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT title FROM documents 
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('postgresql & performance');

-- Partition pruning
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';
```

## 🔍 Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
```bash
make monitor  # Comprehensive dashboard
```

### Query Analysis
```bash
make enable-stats  # Enable pg_stat_statements
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
make pgbadger  # Generate detailed report
```

### Key Metrics
- **Buffer Hit Ratio**: >95% (excellent), >90% (good)
- **Index Usage**: High for frequently queried tables
- **Connection Usage**: <80% of max_connections
- **Query Performance**: Track slow queries >100ms

## 🎓 Interview Preparation

### Common Questions & Demos

**"How would you tune a slow query?"**
```sql
-- 1. Analyze the query
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT ...;
-- 2. Check index usage
-- 3. Adjust work_mem if needed
-- 4. Measure improvement
```

**"Explain PostgreSQL memory management"**
- shared_buffers: Database cache
- work_mem: Query operations
- effective_cache_size: OS cache estimate

**"How do you monitor performance?"**
- pg_stat_statements for query analysis
- Buffer cache hit ratios
- Real-time connection monitoring

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Container won't start
make clean && make quick-start

# pg_stat_statements error
make enable-stats

# Performance issues
# Ensure Docker has 2GB+ RAM
```

### Diagnostic Queries
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT pid, query_start, query FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < now() - interval '30 seconds';

-- Check blocking queries
SELECT blocked.pid, blocking.pid, blocked.query 
FROM pg_stat_activity blocked 
JOIN pg_locks blocked_locks ON blocked.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.transactionid = blocked_locks.transactionid
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking ON blocking.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE blocked.pid != blocking.pid;
```

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

1. __Rajesh Madiwale__

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.


This PostgreSQL 17 tuning demo is complete and validated for professional use across all platforms.
